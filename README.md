# Leviathan
Cross-platform GM Tool for SphereServer.<br>
Non-windows versions lack, for now, the "send text to client" feature.<br>
Consider it at an embryonal stage, since it lacks lots of features, and a slow-progressing project.<br>
Some things could have be done more easily using Qt classes, but i'd rather write code that can be recycled for other projects (which aren't necessarily using Qt).<br>
