# Leviathan
GM Tool for SphereServer.
Consider it in an embryonal stage, since it lacks lots of features, and a slow-progressing project.
Some things could have be done more easily using Qt classes, but i'd rather write code that can be recycled for other projects (which aren't necessarily using Qt).

# Credits
I used (and plan to use in the future) much of the logic and the code behind AxisII by Ben Croussette (https://github.com/Ben1028/Axis2).
Uses Qt Toolkit version 5.7.
Uses CheckableProxyModel (GPLv3 or later versions, as of 2011) by Andre Somers.
